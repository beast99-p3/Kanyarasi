# Agent Explanation

## Reasoning Process

The agent uses a structured approach to process user requests:

1. **Task Analysis**
   - Parses user input for intent and requirements
   - Identifies necessary tools and information
   - Breaks complex tasks into manageable subtasks

2. **Planning**
   - Creates step-by-step execution plans
   - Prioritizes tasks based on dependencies
   - Selects appropriate tools for each step
   - Validates plan feasibility

3. **Execution**
   - Sequential task processing
   - Dynamic tool selection and coordination
   - Progress monitoring and error handling
   - Real-time plan adjustment

## Memory Usage

The agent employs a multi-tiered memory system:

1. **Short-term Memory**
   - Current conversation context
   - Active task state
   - Temporary computational results
   - Recent user interactions

2. **Long-term Memory**
   - Conversation history
   - User preferences
   - Previous task results
   - Learned patterns

3. **Memory Management**
   - Configurable memory length
   - Context-aware retrieval
   - Automatic cleanup of old entries
   - Relevance scoring

## Tool Integration

1. **Gemini API Integration**
   - Core language processing
   - Task analysis and planning
   - Response generation
   - Content moderation

2. **Additional Tools**
   - Web search capabilities
   - Code analysis and execution
   - Data visualization
   - Memory management

## Known Limitations

1. **API Constraints**
   - Rate limits (50 requests/day on free tier)
   - Response time variations
   - Context window size limits

2. **Memory Constraints**
   - Limited conversation history
   - Context window restrictions
   - Storage optimization needs

3. **Tool Limitations**
   - API dependency and limitation issues
   - Tool availability
   - Integration complexity
